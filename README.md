# Developed a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions on a large-scale financial dataset (6M+ records). The project involved a thorough EDA - data cleaning, outlier treatment, feature engineering (log transformations, balance differences), and encoding of categorical variables. Trained a Random Forest classifier with hyperparameter tuning and balanced class weights to handle severe class imbalance. Achieved high recall (0.93) for fraudulent transactions while maintaining overall accuracy. Identified key predictors such as transaction amount, balance changes, and transaction types, providing actionable business insights and suggestions for fraud prevention.
